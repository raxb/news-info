# news-info

In todayâ€™s world, information is abundant and everywhere but not all that glitters are gold, we need to read through multiple sources, we need to process, we need to synthesis, we need to trial and error, we need to get opinions and in the last we come to profound realization that this information is not right, this information is misleading, this information is  might not be the relevant, and we have the time lost, resources lost.
Having first hand information at hand helps in making informed decisions precisely.
How can this be eliminated, how to confirm the authenticity, relevancy?
1.	It has to be from the right sources with enclosed proofs (should be incentivized to post content)
2.	Endorsed by experts, interest groups and etc (should be incentivized to do so)
3.	Evaluable with preliminary information (consumer should do this)
Build a system to provide information, curb fake, misleading, irrelevant information.
Start with local news

__1	Confirmed by independent Sources	Logical, consistent with other relevant information, confirmed by independent sources.
2	Probably true	Logical, consistent with other relevant information, not confirmed.
3	Possibly true	Reasonably logical, agrees with some relevant information, not confirmed.
4	Doubtful	Not logical but possible, no other information on the subject, not confirmed.
5	Improbable	Not logical, contradicted by other relevant information.
6	Difficult to say	The validity of the information cannot be determined.__
